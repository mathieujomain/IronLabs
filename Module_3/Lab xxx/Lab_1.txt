Spotify recommendation model is divided in 3 parts: Collaborative filtering, Natural Language Processing and Audio models.
The first one identify titles listened by users and find paterns of taste. In other words the collaborative filtering recommend title based on what other users liked
(liked song or added to a playlist)
Natural language processing look for article, blog post that mention a specific song / artist and recognize key-words used to describe them. 
Based on those keywords, songs and artists are placed into groups.
The audio model is acquired by the use of convolutional neural networks. The result data is information about the tempo, volume, time signature...
This process analyze the raw audio of each title without taking into consideration the notoriety of the artist. That way it can even recomend title from a not famous artist.

By combining those 3 elements spotify is able to create a weekly playlist for each users with various songs according to its taste.
